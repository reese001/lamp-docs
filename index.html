        <div>
            <h2>Installing Apache</h2>
            <p>First, we are going to look at how to install Apache2 in Ubuntu. Make sure you are in your Linux
                terminal, and run the following commands:</p>
            <code>sudo apt update</code><br>
            <code>sudo apt install apache2</code>
            <p>These commands will first install and download the latest package information, then will install the
                latest version of Apache2. Apache is now installed!</p>
            <p>Next we are going to want to create a directory to hold the files for our website. Fir we need to
                navigate to the /var/www directory:</p>
            <code>cd /var/www</code>
            <p>Now that we are in the /var/www directory, we are going to create a new folder to hold our website files.
                Usually it is standard practice to name this folder the same as the name of your website</p>
            <code>sudo mkdir &lt;sitename&gt;</code>
            <p>This is where all the files for your website will be kept. We will work with this in a later step.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="php-install">
            <h2>Installing PHP</h2>
            <p>The next step is to install PHP. Ensure you are in your Linux terminal, and run the following commands:
            </p>
            <code>sudo apt update</code><br>
            <code>sudo apt install php8.2 -y</code>
            <p>If you get an error, you need to run the following command before running the install. This command will
                add the php repository.</p>
            <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php</code>
            <p>Similar to Apache, the update command will make sure you have the latest packages for Ubuntu, then the
                next command will succesfully install php 8.2. the -y just skips the need to type Y to confirm. Please
                note the -y is completely optional.</p>
            <p>Next we have to install the PHP module for Apache.</p>
            <code>sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php8.2 -y</code>
            <p>This command installs the PHP module for Apache so they can work together</p>
            <p>Finally, we have to install the MySQL module for PHP</p>
            <code>sudo apt install php8.2-mysql -y</code>
            <p>This command installs the MySQL module for PHP so they can work together, just like the Apache module.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div id="mysql-install">
            <h2>Installing MySQL</h2>
            <p>Next we are going to go over how to install and setup MySQL.</p>
            <p>First we want to run the following command</p>
            <code>sudo apt install mysql-server</code>
            <p>This command installs the MySQL server to the Linux environment. You can test that it was succesfully
                installed by running this command</p>
            <code>mysql -V</code>
            <p>This command will output the current version of MySQL, indicating it was succesfully installed to the
                system.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="mysql-db">
            <h2>Creating a new MySQL Database</h2>
            <p>Another step in MySQL is creating a database. First we need to be able to interact with MySQL through the
                command line, so we use the following command:</p>
            <code>sudo mysql</code>
            <p>Now that we are interacting with MySQL through the command line, we have to create a new database using
                the create database command</p>
            <code>CREATE DATABASE &lt;database name;&gt;</code>
            <p>Make sure to remove the &lt; and &gt; signs before pressing enter. This command will create a new
                database with the name that you input</p>
        </div>

        <div id="mysql-user">
            <h2>Creating a new MySQL User</h2>
            <p>Another step in configuring MySQL is creating a user. To create a user with a secure password, we need to
                run the following command:</p>
            <code>CREATE USER &lt;'username'@'%'&gt; IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY &lt;'password'&gt;</code>
            <p>Running this command will have created a new user with the username and password you have specified.
                Again you should remove the &lt; and &gt; signs before running the command.</p>
            <p>Next we need to grant the user privileges to the database we created. To do this we run the following</p>
            <code>GRANT ALL ON &lt;database.*&gt; to &lt;'username'@'%';&gt;</code>
            <p>Replace database with the name of the database you created, and username with the name of the user you
                created. This command will grant the user all privileges to the database you created.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="apache-vhost">
            <h2>Configuring a Virtual Host</h2>
            <p>Moving back to Apache, we need to configure a virtual host to test that everything is running. This
                involves editing the configuration files. First we must navigate to the apache sites-available directory
                by running the following command:</p>
            <code>cd /etc/apache2/sites-available</code>
            <p>Inside this directory there is a file called 000-default.conf, which we can confirm by running the
                command <strong>ls -l</strong>. We are going to want to copy this file and rename it to the name of our
                site.</p>
            <code>sudo cp 000-default.conf &lt;sitename.conf&gt;</code>
            <p>Change sitename.conf to whatever the name of your site. Note that it does not have to be the name of your
                website, it is just a naming convention.</p>
            <p>Now that we have a new .conf file we have to edit it using the nano text editor. We can do this by using
                the nano command</p>
            <code>sudo nano &lt;filename&gt;</code>
            <p>Now we are in the contents of the file, and can edit and write new lines. For this example we will be
                using the default VirtualHost*80, but if you want to use a different port, you must create a new
                VirtualHost entry.</p>
            <p>Inside of &lt;VirtualHost*80&gt;, we are going to want to add a new ServerName and ServerAlias directive.
            </p>
            <code>ServerName &lt;desiredurl&gt;</code><br>
            <code>ServerAlias &lt;www.desiredurl&gt;</code>
            <p>Note that the ServerAlias can be whatever you want, it is just standard practice to use the same URL as
                ServerName, just with www in front of it.</p>
            <p>What this does is creates a virtual host that allows you to connect to your website using those 2 URL's.
            </p>
            <p>Next we need to change our DocumentRoot to the directory containing your website files inside /var/www.
                To do this we need
                to add a new DocumentRoot directive</p>
            <code>DocumentRoot /var/www/&lt;directoryname&gt;</code>
            <p>To allow you to connect to this URL locally, we need to edit the hosts file on our system. In this
                example I will be showing how it is done in Windows.</p>
            <p>First we need to navigate to the directory where the hosts file is located. We can just do this in the
                file explorer. The hosts file is located in the path below:</p>
            <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc</code>
            <p>In this directory you will see a file named hosts. We need to open it using a text editor such as
                Notepad++. Inside the file, at the bottom of the page we need to add the following lines:</p>
            <code>127.0.0.1  &lt;desiredurl&gt;</code><br>
            <code>127.0.0.1  &lt;www.desiredurl&gt;</code>
            <p><strong>It is important that these URL's match the same one's we used for the VirtualHost!</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div id="test-lamp">
            <h2>Testing the LAMP Stack</h2>
            <p>Finally we must test our stack! To start, we should create a php file in the directory we created in
                /var/www. For this, you should use a text editor such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code.</p>
            <p>If Visual Studio Code is installed, we first want to open it, and open the /var/www/&lt;foldername&gt;
                that was created in the Installing Apache step. In this folder, we want to create a new file named
                index.php</p>
            <p>Inside index.php, we want to write the following code:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;?php<br>
                $mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database");<br>
                if ($mysqli->connect_errno) {<br>
                    echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: " . $mysqli->connect_error;<br>
                    exit();<br>
                }<br>
                echo "Connected to MySQL successfully!";<br>
                $mysqli->close();<br>
            </code>
            <p>Replace username, password, and database with the username, password, and database you created in the
                MySQL steps. This code will connect to the MySQL database and output a message if it was successful.</p>
            <p>We should reload Apache now before enabling the site. To reload Apache, use the command</p>
            <code>sudo systemctl reload apache2</code>
            <p>This will reload Apache. Now it is time to enable the site. To enable a site in Apache, use the command
                below</p>
            <code>sudo a2ensite &lt;filename&gt;</code>
            <p>Replace filename with the name of the .conf file you created in the Configuring a Virtual Host step. This
                will enable the site and allow you to connect to it.</p>
            <p>Finally go to your web browser and type in the URL you used for your virtual host, and you should see a
                page that says you are connected to MySQL!</p>
